what is node modeule =>
------------------------

for managing dependencies and it help to use third party libaires code in project .

package.json
--------------

package.json is file contains  all third part install libries and dependencies and also containe project meta data of nodejs project like  project name , version of poject, author, and vesion.

package.lock.json
-------------------

what are dependencies:-
-----------------------
In the package.json file, there is an object called dependencies  it consist of all package  that are used in project with its version of package. so, whenever install any libraries that is required in project that library you can find in the dependencies object .

what are dev dependecies: - 
---------------------------

different between caret and tilde '^' and '~'
----------------------------------------------
"express": "~4.16.3"    // tilde for patch updates
"express": "^4.16.3"    //  caret for flexible updates

Tilde (~) notation
----------------------
The tilde (~) notation is employed to match the latest patch version while freezing the major and minor versions. This notation is useful for automatically accepting bug fixes, considering that patch updates primarily address bugs.

Example: The ~1.2.0 will update all the future patch updates. We have to write just ~1.2.0 and all the next patch update dependencies. For example, 1.2.1, 1.2.2, 1.2.5……………1.2.x.
Note: Patch updates are very small security changes in a package that is why the ~version is approximately equivalent to the version.

Use ~ when you want to avoid minor version updates but still receive patch updates for bug fixes.

Caret (^) notation
--------------------
It automatically updates both minor and patch updates.

Example: The ^1.2.4 will update all the future Minor and patch updates, for example, ^1.2.4 will automatically change the dependency to 1.x.x if any update occurs.
